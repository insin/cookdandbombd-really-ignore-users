![Extension Logo](icons/icon128.png)

Really ignores ignored users on cookdandbombd.co.uk

* [Install Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cab-really-ignore-users/)
* [Install Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bnmminpkjkhedhadjfblifhbaoemgadi/)
* [Install as a user script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/426666-cook-d-and-bomb-d-really-ignore-users) (requires a [user script manager](https://greasyfork.org/en#home-step-1))

## After installing

Visit your [Ignore List](https://www.cookdandbombd.co.uk/forums/index.php?action=profile;area=lists;sa=ignore) and the extension will synchronise itself with your ignored users.

The following will now be hidden in topics (and when posting replies):

- "You are ignoring this user" placeholders for posts by ignored users
- Posts which quote an ignored user

Topics created by ignored users will also be hidden.

## Easier ignoring

The extension also makes it easier to add people to your Ignore List - a new "Add to ignore list" control will be added to a user's profile next to their posts:

Clicking it will take you to your Ignore List and automatically handle adding the user to it.

## Viewing hidden posts and unignoring

To temporarily view hidden posts, open your browser's right-click/context menu and click "Show ignored posts" (this will be a top-level item in Firefox and under a "Cook'd and Bomb'd Really Ignore Users" menu item in Chrome).

| Firefox | Chrome |
|:-------:|:------:|

Ignored posts will be displayed with a fetching salmon highlight and clicking the new "Remove from ignore list" control in an ignored user's profile will take you to your Ignore List and automatically handle removing the user from it.

You can then re-hide ignored posts using the same menu item the next time you're viewing a topic.

## Options

Some of the behaviour described above can be configured in the extension's options:
